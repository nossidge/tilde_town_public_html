Mr. Tambourine Man
Bob Dylan


Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
        F                Bb              C         Csus4   C
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
       F             Bb                C         F
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you


         Bb                 C          F             Bb
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand
F                Bb
Vanished from my hand
        F               Bb                  C          Csus4   C
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
   Bb         C             F             Bb
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
  F              Bb
I have no one to meet
        F             Bb                C              Csus4   C
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
        F                Bb              C         Csus4   C
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
       F             Bb                C         F
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you


Bb           C              F              Bb
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
   F                Bb
My senses have been stripped
   F                   Bb
My hands can't feel to grip
   F                Bb
My toes too numb to step
     F           Bb               C           Csus4   C
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
    Bb          C             F            Bb
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  F           Bb
Into my own parade
          F                Bb             C           Csus4   C
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
        F                Bb              C         Csus4   C
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
       F             Bb                C         F
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you


           Bb                   C                  F                Bb
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
         F           Bb
It's not aimed at anyone
           F              Bb
It's just escaping on the run
        F                 Bb            C        Csus4   C
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
           Bb         C         F                 Bb
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
        F             Bb
To your tambourine in time
            F              Bb
It's just a ragged clown behind
           F          Bb
I wouldn't pay it any mind
            F             Bb               C         Csus4   C
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
        F                Bb              C         Csus4   C

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you


Bb           C                   F                 Bb
Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
         F              Bb
Down the foggy ruins of time
    F               Bb
Far past the frozen leaves
    F                  Bb
The haunted frightened trees
    F            Bb
Out to the windy beach
    F                Bb             C        Csus4   C
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
        Bb                C                F               Bb
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
      F            Bb
Silhouetted by the sea
        F             Bb
Circled by the circus sands
         F          Bb
With all memory and fate
       F                Bb
Driven deep beneath the waves
          F         Bb            C        Csus4   C
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
        F                Bb              C         Csus4   C
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Bb       C               F               Bb
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
       F             Bb                C         F
