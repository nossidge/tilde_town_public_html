"Here we come a-wassailing<br>Among the leaves so green,<br>Here we come a-wand&#39;ring<br>So fair to be seen.",
"We are not daily beggars<br>That beg from door to door;<br>But we are neighbours&#39; children,<br>Whom you have seen before.",
"Call up the butler of this house,<br>Put on his golden ring.<br>Let him bring us a glass of beer,<br>And better we shall sing.",
"We have got a little purse<br>Of stretching leather skin;<br>We want a little of your coin<br>To line it well within.",
"Bring us out a table<br>And spread it with a cloth;<br>Bring us out a mouldy cheese,<br>And of your Christmas loaf.",
"God bless the master of this house,<br>Likewise the mistress too;<br>And all the little children<br>That round the table go.",
"Good master and good mistress,<br>As you sit beside the fire,<br>Pray think of us poor children<br>Who are wand&#39;ring in the mire.",
"It came upon the midnight clear,<br>That glorious song of old,<br>From angels bending near the earth,<br>To touch their harps of gold:",
"&quot;Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,<br>From heaven&#39;s all-gracious King.&quot;<br>The world in solemn stillness lay,<br>To hear the angels sing.",
"Still through the cloven skies they come,<br>With peaceful wings unfurled,<br>And still their heavenly music floats<br>O&#39;er all the weary world;",
"Above its sad and lowly plains,<br>They bend on hovering wing,<br>And ever o&#39;er its Babel sounds<br>The bless√®d angels sing.",
"Yet with the woes of sin and strife<br>The world has suffered long;<br>Beneath the angel-strain have rolled<br>Two thousand years of wrong;",
"And man, at war with man, hears not<br>The love-song which they bring;<br>O hush the noise, ye men of strife,<br>And hear the angels sing.",
"And ye, beneath life&#39;s crushing load,<br>Whose forms are bending low,<br>Who toil along the climbing way<br>With painful steps and slow,",
"Look now! for glad and golden hours<br>Come swiftly on the wing.<br>O rest beside the weary road,<br>And hear the angels sing!",
"For lo!, the days are hastening on,<br>By prophet bards foretold,<br>When with the ever-circling years<br>Comes round the age of gold",
"When peace shall over all the earth<br>Its ancient splendors fling,<br>And the whole world give back the song<br>Which now the angels sing.",
"While shepherds watched their flocks by night,<br>All seated on the ground,<br>The angel of the Lord came down,<br>And glory shone around.",
"Fear not, said he, for mighty dread<br>Had seized their troubled mind.<br>Glad tidings of great joy I bring<br>To you and all mankind.",
"To you, in David&#39;s town, this day<br>Is born of David&#39;s line<br>A Saviour, which is Christ the Lord,<br>And this shall be the sign.",
"The heavenly Babe you there shall find<br>To human view displayed,<br>All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,<br>And in a manger laid.",
"Thus spake the Seraph, and forthwith<br>Appeared a heavenly throng<br>Of Angels praising God and thus,<br>Addressed their joyful song.",
"All glory be to God on high,<br>And to the earth be peace;<br>Good will henceforth from heaven to earth<br>Begin and never cease!",
"O little town of Bethlehem,<br>How still we see thee lie!<br>Above your deep and dreamless sleep,<br>The silent stars go by.",
"Yet in thy dark streets shineth<br>The everlasting Light,<br>The hopes and fears of all the years,<br>Are met in thee tonight.",
"O morning stars, together<br>Proclaim thy holy birth<br>And praises sing to God, the King,<br>And peace to men on earth.",
"For Christ is born of Mary,<br>And gathered all above,<br>While mortals sleep, the angels keep<br>Their watch of wondering love.",
"How silently, how silently,<br>The wondrous Gift is giv&#39;n!<br>So God imparts to human hearts<br>The blessings of His heaven.",
"No ear may hear His coming,<br>But in this world of sin,<br>Where meek souls will receive Him still,<br>The dear Christ enters in.",
"O holy Child of Bethlehem<br>Descend to us, we pray.<br>Cast out our sin and enter in,<br>Be born to us today.",
"We hear the Christmas angels,<br>The great glad tidings tell.<br>O come to us, abide with us,<br>Our Lord Emmanuel!",
"God rest ye merry, gentlemen<br>Let nothing you dismay<br>Remember, Christ, our Saviour<br>Was born on Christmas day",
"In Bethlehem, in Israel,<br>This blessed Babe was born<br>And laid within a manger<br>Upon this blessed morn",
"From God our Heavenly Father<br>A blessed Angel came;<br>And unto certain Shepherds<br>Brought tidings of the same",
"This day is born a Saviour<br>Of a pure Virgin bright,<br>To free all those who trust in Him<br>From Satan&#39;s power and might.&quot;",
"The shepherds at those tidings<br>Rejoiced much in mind,<br>And left their flocks a-feeding<br>In tempest, storm and wind",
"And when they came to Bethlehem<br>Where our dear Saviour lay,<br>They found Him in a manger,<br>Where oxen feed on hay",
"Now to the Lord sing praises,<br>All you within this place,<br>And with true love and brotherhood<br>Each other now embrace",
"Strange fits of passion have I known:<br>And I will dare to tell,<br>But in the Lover&#39;s ear alone,<br>What once to me befell.",
"When she I loved looked every day<br>Fresh as a rose in June,<br>I to her cottage bent my way,<br>Beneath an evening-moon.",
"Upon the moon I fixed my eye,<br>All over the wide lea;<br>With quickening pace my horse drew nigh<br>Those paths so dear to me.",
"And now we reached the orchard-plot;<br>And, as we climbed the hill,<br>The sinking moon to Lucy&#39;s cot<br>Came near, and nearer still.",
"In one of those sweet dreams I slept,<br>Kind Nature&#39;s gentlest boon!<br>And all the while my eyes I kept<br>On the descending moon.",
"My horse moved on; hoof after hoof<br>He raised, and never stopped:<br>When down behind the cottage roof,<br>At once, the bright moon dropped.",
"What fond and wayward thoughts will slide<br>Into a Lover&#39;s head!<br>&quot;O mercy!&quot; to myself I cried,<br>&quot;If Lucy should be dead!&quot;",
"A slumber did my spirit seal;<br>I had no human fears:<br>She seemed a thing that could not feel<br>The touch of earthly years.",
"No motion has she now, no force;<br>She neither hears nor sees;<br>Rolled round in earth&#39;s diurnal course,<br>With rocks, and stones, and trees.",
"I travelled among unknown men,<br>In lands beyond the sea;<br>Nor, England! did I know till then<br>What love I bore to thee.",
"&#39;Tis past, that melancholy dream!<br>Nor will I quit thy shore<br>A second time; for still I seem<br>To love thee more and more.",
"Among thy mountains did I feel<br>The joy of my desire;<br>And she I cherished turned her wheel<br>Beside an English fire.",
"Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed<br>The bowers where Lucy played;<br>And thine too is the last green field<br>That Lucy&#39;s eyes surveyed.",
"She dwelt among the untrodden ways<br>Beside the springs of Dove,<br>A Maid whom there were none to praise<br>And very few to love:",
"A violet by a mossy stone<br>Half hidden from the eye!<br>--Fair as a star, when only one<br>Is shining in the sky.",
"She lived unknown, and few could know<br>When Lucy ceased to be;<br>But she is in her grave, and, oh,<br>The difference to me!",
"A simple child, dear brother Jim,<br>That lightly draws its breath,<br>And feels its life in every limb,<br>What should it know of death?",
"I met a little cottage girl,<br>She was eight years old, she said;<br>Her hair was thick with many a curl<br>That cluster&#39;d round her head.",
"She had a rustic, woodland air,<br>And she was wildly clad;<br>Her eyes were fair, and very fair,<br>--Her beauty made me glad.",
"&quot;And where are they, I pray you tell?&quot;<br>She answered, &quot;Seven are we,<br>And two of us at Conway dwell,<br>And two are gone to sea.&quot;",
"&quot;Two of us in the church-yard lie,<br>My sister and my brother,<br>And in the church-yard cottage, I<br>Dwell near them with my mother.&quot;",
"&quot;You say that two at Conway dwell,<br>And two are gone to sea,<br>Yet you are seven; I pray you tell<br>Sweet Maid, how this may be?&quot;",
"Then did the little Maid reply,<br>&quot;Seven boys and girls are we;<br>Two of us in the church-yard lie,<br>Beneath the church-yard tree.&quot;",
"&quot;You run about, my little maid,<br>Your limbs they are alive;<br>If two are in the church-yard laid,<br>Then ye are only five.&quot;",
"&quot;Their graves are green, they may be seen,&quot;<br>The little Maid replied,<br>&quot;Twelve steps or more from my mother&#39;s door,<br>And they are side by side.&quot;",
"&quot;My stockings there I often knit,<br>My &#39;kerchief there I hem;<br>And there upon the ground I sit--<br>I sit and sing to them.&quot;",
"&quot;And often after sunset, Sir,<br>When it is light and fair,<br>I take my little porringer,<br>And eat my supper there.&quot;",
"&quot;The first that died was little Jane;<br>In bed she moaning lay,<br>Till God released her of her pain,<br>And then she went away.&quot;",
"&quot;So in the church-yard she was laid,<br>And all the summer dry,<br>Together round her grave we played,<br>My brother John and I.&quot;",
"&quot;And when the ground was white with snow,<br>And I could run and slide,<br>My brother John was forced to go,<br>And he lies by her side.&quot;",
"&quot;How many are you then,&quot; said I,<br>&quot;If they two are in Heaven?&quot;<br>The little Maiden did reply,<br>&quot;O Master! we are seven.&quot;",
"&quot;Hope&quot; is the thing with feathers -<br>That perches in the soul -<br>And sings the tune without the words -<br>And never stops - at all -",
"And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>And sore must be the storm -<br>That could abash the little Bird<br>That kept so many warm -",
"I‚Äôve heard it in the chillest land -<br>And on the strangest Sea -<br>Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>It asked a crumb - of me.",
"The morns are meeker than they were -<br>The nuts are getting brown -<br>The berry‚Äôs cheek is plumper -<br>The rose is out of town.",
"The maple wears a gayer scarf -<br>The field a scarlet gown -<br>Lest I sh&#39;d be old-fashioned<br>I‚Äôll put a trinket on.",
"The Bridegroom&#39;s doors are opened wide,<br>And I am next of kin;<br>The guests are met, the feast is set:<br>May&#39;st hear the merry din.&#39;",
"He holds him with his skinny hand,<br>&#39;There was a ship,&#39; quoth he.<br>&#39;Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!&#39;<br>Eftsoons his hand dropt he.",
"He holds him with his glittering eye‚Äî<br>The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br>And listens like a three years&#39; child:<br>The Mariner hath his will.",
"The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:<br>He cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.",
"&#39;The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br>Merrily did we drop<br>Below the kirk, below the hill,<br>Below the lighthouse top.",
"The Sun came up upon the left,<br>Out of the sea came he!<br>And he shone bright, and on the right<br>Went down into the sea.",
"Higher and higher every day,<br>Till over the mast at noon‚Äî&#39;<br>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br>For he heard the loud bassoon.",
"The bride hath paced into the hall,<br>Red as a rose is she;<br>Nodding their heads before her goes<br>The merry minstrelsy.",
"The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br>Yet he cannot choose but hear;<br>And thus spake on that ancient man,<br>The bright-eyed Mariner.",
"And now the storm-blast came, and he<br>Was tyrannous and strong:<br>He struck with his o&#39;ertaking wings,<br>And chased us south along.",
"And now there came both mist and snow,<br>And it grew wondrous cold:<br>And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br>As green as emerald.",
"And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br>Did send a dismal sheen:<br>Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken‚Äî<br>The ice was all between.",
"The ice was here, the ice was there,<br>The ice was all around:<br>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br>Like noises in a swound!",
"At length did cross an Albatross,<br>Thorough the fog it came;<br>As if it had been a Christian soul,<br>We hailed it in God&#39;s name.",
"It ate the food it ne&#39;er had eat,<br>And round and round it flew.<br>The ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br>The helmsman steered us through!",
"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br>It perched for vespers nine;<br>Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br>Glimmered the white Moon-shine.&#39;",
"&#39;God save thee, ancient Mariner!<br>From the fiends, that plague thee thus!‚Äî<br>Why look&#39;st thou so?&#39;‚ÄîWith my cross-bow<br>I shot the Albatross.",
"The Sun now rose upon the right:<br>Out of the sea came he,<br>Still hid in mist, and on the left<br>Went down into the sea.",
"And I had done a hellish thing,<br>And it would work &#39;em woe:<br>For all averred, I had killed the bird<br>That made the breeze to blow.",
"Nor dim nor red, like God&#39;s own head,<br>The glorious Sun uprist:<br>Then all averred, I had killed the bird<br>That brought the fog and mist.",
"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,<br>The furrow followed free;<br>We were the first that ever burst<br>Into that silent sea.",
"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,<br>&#39;Twas sad as sad could be;<br>And we did speak only to break<br>The silence of the sea!",
"All in a hot and copper sky,<br>The bloody Sun, at noon,<br>Right up above the mast did stand,<br>No bigger than the Moon.",
"Water, water, every where,<br>And all the boards did shrink;<br>Water, water, every where,<br>Nor any drop to drink.",
"The very deep did rot: O Christ!<br>That ever this should be!<br>Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br>Upon the slimy sea.",
"About, about, in reel and rout<br>The death-fires danced at night;<br>The water, like a witch&#39;s oils,<br>Burnt green, and blue and white.",
"And every tongue, through utter drought,<br>Was withered at the root;<br>We could not speak, no more than if<br>We had been choked with soot.",
"At first it seemed a little speck,<br>And then it seemed a mist;<br>It moved and moved, and took at last<br>A certain shape, I wist.",
"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!<br>And still it neared and neared:<br>As if it dodged a water-sprite,<br>It plunged and tacked and veered.",
"The Sun&#39;s rim dips; the stars rush out;<br>At one stride comes the dark;<br>With far-heard whisper, o&#39;er the sea,<br>Off shot the spectre-bark.",
"The souls did from their bodies fly,‚Äî<br>They fled to bliss or woe!<br>And every soul, it passed me by,<br>Like the whizz of my cross-bow!",
"&#39;I fear thee, ancient Mariner!<br>I fear thy skinny hand!<br>And thou art long, and lank, and brown,<br>As is the ribbed sea-sand.",
"The many men, so beautiful!<br>And they all dead did lie:<br>And a thousand thousand slimy things<br>Lived on; and so did I.",
"I looked upon the rotting sea,<br>And drew my eyes away;<br>I looked upon the rotting deck,<br>And there the dead men lay.",
"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,<br>Nor rot nor reek did they:<br>The look with which they looked on me<br>Had never passed away.",
"The moving Moon went up the sky,<br>And no where did abide:<br>Softly she was going up,<br>And a star or two beside‚Äî",
"The self-same moment I could pray;<br>And from my neck so free<br>The Albatross fell off, and sank<br>Like lead into the sea.",
"The silly buckets on the deck,<br>That had so long remained,<br>I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<br>And when I awoke, it rained.",
"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<br>My garments all were dank;<br>Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<br>And still my body drank.",
"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:<br>I was so light‚Äîalmost<br>I thought that I had died in sleep,<br>And was a blessed ghost.",
"And soon I heard a roaring wind:<br>It did not come anear;<br>But with its sound it shook the sails,<br>That were so thin and sere.",
"The loud wind never reached the ship,<br>Yet now the ship moved on!<br>Beneath the lightning and the Moon<br>The dead men gave a groan.",
"The body of my brother&#39;s son<br>Stood by me, knee to knee:<br>The body and I pulled at one rope,<br>But he said nought to me.",
"For when it dawned‚Äîthey dropped their arms,<br>And clustered round the mast;<br>Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br>And from their bodies passed.",
"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br>Then darted to the Sun;<br>Slowly the sounds came back again,<br>Now mixed, now one by one.",
"And now &#39;twas like all instruments,<br>Now like a lonely flute;<br>And now it is an angel&#39;s song,<br>That makes the heavens be mute.",
"Till noon we quietly sailed on,<br>Yet never a breeze did breathe:<br>Slowly and smoothly went the ship,<br>Moved onward from beneath.",
"Then like a pawing horse let go,<br>She made a sudden bound:<br>It flung the blood into my head,<br>And I fell down in a swound.",
"The other was a softer voice,<br>As soft as honey-dew:<br>Quoth he, &#39;The man hath penance done,<br>And penance more will do.&#39;",
"Still as a slave before his lord,<br>The ocean hath no blast;<br>His great bright eye most silently<br>Up to the Moon is cast‚Äî",
"The pang, the curse, with which they died,<br>Had never passed away:<br>I could not draw my eyes from theirs,<br>Nor turn them up to pray.",
"And now this spell was snapt: once more<br>I viewed the ocean green,<br>And looked far forth, yet little saw<br>Of what had else been seen‚Äî",
"But soon there breathed a wind on me,<br>Nor sound nor motion made:<br>Its path was not upon the sea,<br>In ripple or in shade.",
"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<br>Yet she sailed softly too:<br>Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze‚Äî<br>On me alone it blew.",
"Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed<br>The light-house top I see?<br>Is this the hill? is this the kirk?<br>Is this mine own countree?",
"We drifted o&#39;er the harbour-bar,<br>And I with sobs did pray‚Äî<br>O let me be awake, my God!<br>Or let me sleep alway.",
"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<br>So smoothly it was strewn!<br>And on the bay the moonlight lay,<br>And the shadow of the Moon.",
"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,<br>That stands above the rock:<br>The moonlight steeped in silentness<br>The steady weathercock.",
"A little distance from the prow<br>Those crimson shadows were:<br>I turned my eyes upon the deck‚Äî<br>Oh, Christ! what saw I there!",
"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<br>And, by the holy rood!<br>A man all light, a seraph-man,<br>On every corse there stood.",
"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:<br>It was a heavenly sight!<br>They stood as signals to the land,<br>Each one a lovely light;",
"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<br>No voice did they impart‚Äî<br>No voice; but oh! the silence sank<br>Like music on my heart.",
"The Pilot and the Pilot&#39;s boy,<br>I heard them coming fast:<br>Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy<br>The dead men could not blast.",
"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve‚Äî<br>He hath a cushion plump:<br>It is the moss that wholly hides<br>The rotted old oak-stump.",
"The boat came closer to the ship,<br>But I nor spake nor stirred;<br>The boat came close beneath the ship,<br>And straight a sound was heard.",
"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,<br>The boat spun round and round;<br>And all was still, save that the hill<br>Was telling of the sound.",
"I moved my lips ‚Äî the Pilot shrieked<br>And fell down in a fit;<br>The holy Hermit raised his eyes,<br>And prayed where he did sit.",
"And now, all in my own countree,<br>I stood on the firm land!<br>The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,<br>And scarcely he could stand.",
"Since then, at an uncertain hour,<br>That agony returns:<br>And till my ghastly tale is told,<br>This heart within me burns.",
"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,<br>&#39;Tis sweeter far to me,<br>To walk together to the kirk<br>With a goodly company!‚Äî",
"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell<br>To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!<br>He prayeth well, who loveth well<br>Both man and bird and beast.",
"He prayeth best, who loveth best<br>All things both great and small;<br>For the dear God who loveth us,<br>He made and loveth all.",
"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,<br>Whose beard with age is hoar,<br>Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest<br>Turned from the bridegroom&#39;s door.",
"He went like one that hath been stunned,<br>And is of sense forlorn:<br>A sadder and a wiser man,<br>He rose the morrow morn.",
"When Love with unconfin√®d wings<br>Hovers within my gates,<br>And my divine Althea brings<br>To whisper at the grates;",
"When I lie tangled in her hair<br>And fetter&#39;d to her eye,<br>The birds that wanton in the air<br>Know no such liberty.",
"When flowing cups run swiftly round<br>With no allaying Thames,<br>Our careless heads with roses bound,<br>Our hearts with loyal flames;",
"When thirsty grief in wine we steep,<br>When healths and draughts go free‚Äî<br>Fishes that tipple in the deep<br>Know no such liberty.",
"When, like committed linnets, I<br>With shriller throat shall sing<br>The sweetness, mercy, majesty,<br>And glories of my King;",
"When I shall voice aloud how good<br>He is, how great should be,<br>Enlarg√®d winds, that curl the flood,<br>Know no such liberty.",
"Stone walls do not a prison make,<br>Nor iron bars a cage;<br>Minds innocent and quiet take<br>That for an hermitage;",
"If I have freedom in my love<br>And in my soul am free,<br>Angels alone, that soar above,<br>Enjoy such liberty.",
"Oh you may not think I&#39;m pretty,<br>But don&#39;t judge on what you see,<br>I&#39;ll eat myself if you can find<br>A smarter hat than me.",
"You can keep your bowlers black,<br>Your top hats sleek and tall,<br>For I&#39;m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat<br>And I can cap them all.",
"There&#39;s nothing hidden in your head<br>The Sorting Hat can&#39;t see,<br>So try me on and I will tell you<br>Where you ought to be.",
"You might belong in Gryffindor,<br>Where dwell the brave at heart,<br>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br>Set Gryffindors apart;",
"You might belong in Hufflepuff,<br>Where they are just and loyal,<br>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true<br>And unafraid of toil;",
"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br>If you&#39;ve a ready mind,<br>Where those of wit and learning,<br>Will always find their kind;",
"Or perhaps in Slytherin<br>You&#39;ll make your real friends,<br>Those cunning folks use any means<br>To achieve their ends.",
"So put me on! Don&#39;t be afraid!<br>And don&#39;t get in a flap!<br>You&#39;re in safe hands (though I have none)<br>For I&#39;m a Thinking Cap!",
"A thousand years or more ago<br>When I was newly sewn,<br>There lived four wizards of renown,<br>Whose names are still well known:",
"Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,<br>Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,<br>Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,<br>Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.",
"They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,<br>They hatched a daring plan<br>To educate young sorcerers<br>Thus Hogwarts School began.",
"Now each of these four founders<br>Formed their own house, for each<br>Did value different virtues<br>In the ones they had to teach.",
"By Gryffindor, the bravest were<br>Prized far beyond the rest;<br>For Ravenclaw, the cleverest<br>Would always be the best;",
"While still alive they did divide<br>Their favourites from the throng,<br>Yet how to pick the worthy ones<br>When they were dead and gone?",
"Twas Gryffindor who found the way,<br>He whipped me off his head<br>The founders put some brains in me<br>So I could choose instead!",
"Now slip me snug about your ears,<br>I&#39;ve never yet been wrong,<br>I&#39;ll have a look inside your mind<br>And tell where you belong!",
"So how could it have gone so wrong?<br>How could such friendships fail?<br>Why, I was there, so I can tell<br>The whole sad, sorry tale.",
"Said Gryffindor, &quot;We&#39;ll teach all those<br>With brave deeds to their name.&quot;<br>Said Hufflepuff, &quot;I&#39;ll teach the lot<br>And treat them just the same.&quot;",
"The Houses that, like pillars four<br>Had once held up our school<br>Now turned upon each other and<br>Divided, sought to rule.",

"They stayed there from the hour of birth<br>Until the day they died<br>They never cared for any earth<br>Except their Mushroom pride",
"They made their homes beneath the caps<br>Of fungi wide and tall<br>And when time came for tea perhaps<br>A neighbor came to call",
"And while they sat in shade serene<br>And offered cream and cakes<br>They talked of things they&#39;d never seen<br>Beyond the Mushroom lakes",
"They did not wish to journey there<br>They were contented so<br>But past the mossy banks somewhere<br>Lie what they did not know",

"A bolt of fear went through him as<br>They thundered through the sky<br>For he saw the Riders comin&#39; hard<br>And heard their mournful cry",
"Their faces burned, their eyes was blurred,<br>Their shirts was soaked with sweat<br>They&#39;re ridin&#39; hard to catch that herd,<br>But they ain&#39;t caught &#39;em yet",
"Then cowboy change your ways today<br>Or with us you will ride<br>Tryin&#39; to catch that Devil&#39;s herd,<br>Across these endless skies",
"Alone until my eighteenth year,<br>We met four springs ago<br>She was shy and had a fear,<br>Of things she did not know",
"But we got it on together<br>In such a super way<br>We held each other close at night,<br>And traded dreams each day",
"We found an old gray house, and you<br>Would not believe the way<br>We worked at night to fix it up,<br>Took classes in the day",
"Painting walls and sipping wine,<br>Sleeping on the floor<br>With so much love with just two, soon<br>We found there&#39;d be one more",
"We had lots of problems then,<br>But we had lots of fun<br>Like the birthday party, when<br>Our baby girl turned one",
"I was proud and satisfied,<br>Life had so much to give<br>Till the day they told me that<br>She didn&#39;t have long to live",
"Now it&#39;s back to two again<br>My little girl and I<br>Who looks so much like her sweet mother,<br>Sometimes that makes me cry",
"She said &quot;It&#39;s just a woman thing&quot;<br>And pulled out of the drive<br>I said not to worry<br>I&#39;m an understanding guy",
"I&#39;ve heard that when you love someone<br>You gotta let &#39;em go<br>She hollered &quot;When I find myself<br>You&#39;ll be the first to know&quot;",
"I learned to do the laundry, feed the cat,<br>And clean the house<br>I promised to be patient while<br>She worked her problems out",
"When she packed her bags,<br>Her destination wasn&#39;t clear<br>But I sensed that her intentions<br>Were honest and sincere",
"Her mama&#39;s been a little vague<br>As to her whereabouts<br>Her sister says &quot;I&#39;m certain your<br>Romance is headed south&quot;"
