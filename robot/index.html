<h1>Robots</h1>
<h2>Why do you like robots?</h2>
Robots can be made of lots of different parts so you could have a robot who can mow the grass or clean the floor or rip someone's arm off.
Robots can be anything you want them to be because they can be programmed. This means that you can get them to get a glass of water or make your bed for you or rip someone's arm off. They are very versatile.

<h2>Robot Weapons</h2>
Robots can have many weapons, such as lasers and spikes and light-sabers and they are stronger than about four people so they can use the weapon really strongly. Some robots are even stonger than four people and if they get a weapon they could kill the world. This is why it is important not to leave weapons in the open because a robot could get it and kill the world. Some robots have ways that they can find weapons that have been hidden using x-ray vision or infra-red vision or magnetism so you should keep all your lasers and spikes and light-sabers hidden in a box.

<h2>The future of Robots</h2>
In the future robots will be cleverer than people and they will be able to think like people do so they will collect all the people together in a big field and then they will use people's energy to make them live. It will be a sad existence for the human race.

<h2>The Three Laws</h2>
The Three Laws of Robotics are these three laws here:
<br><b>1:</b> A robot is not allowed to hurt someone who is not a robot but is also not an animal or a tree and they are not allowed to let anyone else hurt anyone else, unless they are hurting someone who is not not a robot but is also not not an animal or a tree.
<br><b>2:</b> Robots need to do things that they are told, unless they tell them to hurt someone who is not a robot but is also not an animal or a tree.
<br><b>3:</b> If you are a robot, you must try not to get hurt, unless someone has told you that you can, or if it is the only way to stop someone who is not a robot but is also not an animal or a tree from getting hurt.
<br>These laws were invented by a man not a robot so you should not trust them fully to do this.
