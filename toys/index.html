I get this toy for everyone having their first child as all three of mine have loved it. He loved to chew on it. A drawback with other teethers is the baby has to hold it a certain way to chew properly and can end up frustrated.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11619_1400756950335.jpg.pagespeed.ce.VEoGaz8MRX.jpg' height='100' width='100'>I don't know about PVC or plastic coating or anything like that, but I can tell you that it is worth the price if you're planning on having more than one kid. I can see the the educational potential.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11823_1331224135722.jpg.pagespeed.ce.CSkXrsStGT.jpg' height='100' width='100'>A great toy for little hands! It holds her attention which is all you can really ask of any baby toy. My son is 5 months and still enjoys playing with it. He was able to grab it and hold it and eventually started passing it from one hand to the other and holding it up, sticking it in his mouth, playing with it with his feet.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11503_1331224127677.jpg.pagespeed.ce.brdAEx1V9x.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Our 2 month old finds this very interesting to look at and grab. It's one of her favorite toys. It will interest them, but only very briefly. However, I think my grandson, at 10 months old, was a little too old for this toy.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11802_1331224135275.jpg.pagespeed.ce.Qk44v-XrAS.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Our friend bought this as a gift for our 3 month old. Definitely not the same quality of the toys my friends have or that I've seen sold in stores. The toy got dirty so I washed it in some soapy water, this is when it bled green dye all over the wash cloth.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11776_1331224134865.jpg.pagespeed.ce.4394BUgLot.jpg' height='100' width='100'>A great toy for little hands! I highly recommend this toy and all of its uses. The rattle sound is not so loud as to be deafening or obnoxious. I believe it was easier for him to grasp as he was working on his motor skills.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/90xNxii_15960_1343916663770.jpg.pagespeed.ic.ZK-MOMZsKs.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Our 2 month old finds this very interesting to look at and grab.

<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11561_1331224129261.jpg.pagespeed.ce.x_h63NZo99.jpg' height='100' width='100'>My daughter is teething and this is the best toy. When it arrived it was very clean. He was born 6 weeks premature, but because of his interest in this toy he developed two-handed play (an early developmental milestone) well ahead of time.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11807_1331224135420.jpg.pagespeed.ce.s2DLtheXKU.jpg' height='100' width='100'>This toy was one of the first toys that my daughter paid much attention to. I think if it was introduced at a younger age it would have been more interesting to them.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_16333_1354209872954.jpg.pagespeed.ce.__6pEjvTLz.jpg' height='100' width='100'>My 6 month old loves the toy! This is plastic and it purports to be PVC and phaelate free. I chose this product partly because it said it contained a rattle. The loops also make it convenient to take with you.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11845_1331224136409.jpg.pagespeed.ce.PgiddrLrTK.jpg' height='100' width='100'>I bought my daugther the toy at the same time I got her the toy. Its large size but light weight has made her work on passing the toy directly from hand to hand rather than via her mouth, a developmental milestone.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11823_1331224135722.jpg.pagespeed.ce.CSkXrsStGT.jpg' height='100' width='100'>I could see that perhaps an older child might not find this engaging enough, but our son still enjoys playing with it and chewing on it now as a 7 month old. Plus, the many loops mean that there are different things to chew on no matter which way he turns it, there isn't just one right way to hold it.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_18857_1408101670834.jpg.pagespeed.ce.va_JKOKZrx.jpg' height='100' width='100'>My 6 month old loves the toy! It holds her attention which is all you can really ask of any baby toy. He has a teether that he can't yet grasp and manipulate for himself because it is so bulky.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11509_1331224127801.jpg.pagespeed.ce.THEyOmXovv.jpg' height='100' width='100'>This is a nice quality toy. If it's bleeding dye from a little soap, who knows how much dye my little one could ingest when she's chewing on it... He loves to chew on the colorful twists!</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11573_1331224129509.jpg.pagespeed.ce.AZ2poBfhaZ.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Our friend bought this as a gift for our 3 month old. When it arrived it was very clean. You can put it in the fridge when they really start teething. He has a very strong grip and will actually put up a fight when we try to take it away from him!</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11736_1331224134047.jpg.pagespeed.ce.kS4_KG0M2Q.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Perfect for tiny fingers. Bonus: it's easy to wash! I thought it would be a big hit with all the different hand holds and colors and places to chew on. It's light enough and soft/flexible enough he can't really hurt himself with it.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11496_1331224127492.jpg.pagespeed.ce.E0iW9ibiEE.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Perfect for tiny fingers. The bright colors and the soft gummy rings are great. Soft jiggle noise is not annoying. Also great for learning to throw and catch. He can put his entire hand through it and use his arm to get it to his mouth.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11805_1331224135383.jpg.pagespeed.ce.51AEeaEIS-.jpg' height='100' width='100'>It's the first toy my new grandson reached for.

It's definitely his favorite toy and it keeps his attention. She often gets it over her chubby little fists so that she can shake it without dropping it.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11566_1331224129390.jpg.pagespeed.ce.u2Pc3OhyJX.jpg' height='100' width='100'>I gave this to our son when he was ten weeks old. He loves to watch it, hold it, and chew on it with his gums. Can slam it on the highchair tray and still hear myself think.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11790_1331224135054.jpg.pagespeed.ce.i7tUvB-Wtr.jpg' height='100' width='100'>This toy is pliable and rubbery. Needless to say I threw it out. I bought this to amuse my grandson. He is always trying to touch the square in the middle. She often gets it over her chubby little fists so that she can shake it without dropping it.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11769_1331224134746.jpg.pagespeed.ce.fZUlIQdGqO.jpg' height='100' width='100'>I bought my daugther the toy at the same time I got her the toy. We opened up our toy for our oldest son; our daughter used it throughout; and our youngest son has had his hands and mouth on it for two months now.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_17649_1386935781542.jpg.pagespeed.ce.r76eMcPcWH.jpg' height='100' width='100'>It is odd to rate the 'educational' value of this toy. A drawback with other teethers is the baby has to hold it a certain way to chew properly and can end up frustrated.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11668_1331224132706.jpg.pagespeed.ce.5HFzo-3eoH.jpg' height='100' width='100'>My son is currently 4 months old, and this is currently his favorite toy. The multiple loops are easy to grab for my 8 month old to manipulate the toy. In fact, he loves to grab it at both ends and tries his hardest to pull it apart, resulting in loud grunts and shouts and a little frustration!</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_16333_1354209872954.jpg.pagespeed.ce.__6pEjvTLz.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Have yet to meet a baby that doesn't love it. She often gets it over her chubby little fists so that she can shake it without dropping it. My husband and I loved this toy and brought it every where we traveled.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11619_1400756950335.jpg.pagespeed.ce.VEoGaz8MRX.jpg' height='100' width='100'>After hearing other parent comments about how much their little person enjoyed this I decided I would get one for our little boy too. She shakes it and squishes the rings together.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11524_1331224128315.jpg.pagespeed.ce.cxk4hyNiG-.jpg' height='100' width='100'>My little one loved playing with this from very early on, maybe around two months and she has always been tiny. She shakes it and squishes the rings together. My nephew couldn't stop playing with it and he was over 20 pounds at five months.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11527_1331224128365.jpg.pagespeed.ce.EnDkoMvzX7.jpg' height='100' width='100'>One of her favorites. I think if it was introduced at a younger age it would have been more interesting to them. It will interest them, but only very briefly. Our child likes to handle his toy better because it's lighter weight, but will probably enjoy this toy more when he's older.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11586_1331224129812.jpg.pagespeed.ce.EtwS2Nxt2N.jpg' height='100' width='100'>This has been the perfect toy for my 4-month-old: It's one of only 2 toys he's been able to grab with both hands and mouth consistently. This is a simple concept that made it fun for them and it's excellent for developing fine motor skills.</p>
<p><img src='http://static.mumsnet.com/images/reviews/thumbnails/134/ii_11662_1331224132564.jpg.pagespeed.ce.5IlXhFvGd4.jpg' height='100' width='100'>Our baby loves this toy! We did anyway... It will interest them, but only very briefly. It was one of the first toys our daughter was able to really grasp on her own and play with.</p>

The bright colors and the soft gummy rings are great. We did anyway... I think it makes a good first toy. We did anyway...</p>

He is always trying to touch the square in the middle. I think it makes a good first toy. At 7 months she is still very into it.</p>

I chose this product partly because it said it contained a rattle. Its easy to clean as you can just rinse it off with some warm water and dry with a towel.</p>
