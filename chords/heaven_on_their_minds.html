Heaven On Their Minds
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice


           Dm              F            G
My mind is clearer now. At last all too well
      F            G             Dm
I can see where we all soon will be
                      F             G
If you strip away the myth from the man
         F            G             Dm
You will see where we all soon will be
                                     Em
Jesus! You've started to believe the things they say of you
    F                      G                     Dm
You really do believe this talk of God is true
                                  Em
And all the good you've done will soon be swept away
F                           G                         Dm
You've begun to matter more than the things you say


Dm                   F
Listen Jesus I don't like what I see
Dm                    G
All I ask is that you listen to me
Bb            C                             F           A
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along
         Dm                     Bb
You have set them all on fire
                   F                       A
They think they've found the new Messiah
            Dm/A               A            Bb      Dm7
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong


Dm                   F
I remember when this whole thing began
Dm                      G
No talk of God then, we called you a man
Bb             C                     F             A
And believe me my admiration for you hasn't died
          Dm                   Bb
But every word you say today
              F                      A
Gets twisted 'round some other way
            Dm/A             A            Bb     Dm7
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied


Bb              F          Gm                   Dm
Nazareth's most famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Gm              Dm/A          A              Dm
Like his father carving wood, he'd have made good
Bb                 F            Gm                Dm
Tables, chairs and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best
Gm                 Dm/A       A              Dm
He'd have caused nobody harm, no one alarm


Dm                   F
Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Dm                    G
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
Bb               C                          F              A
We are occupied! Have you forgotten how put down we are?
     Dm                        Bb
I am frightened by the crowd
           F                       A
For we are getting much too loud
            Dm/A           A      Bb    Dm7
And they'll crush us if we go too far


Dm                  F
Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Dm                     G
Please remember that I want us to live
Bb                      C                      F            A
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with ev'ry hour
         Dm                    Bb
All your followers are blind
         F                       A
Too much heaven on their minds
       Dm/A           A        Bb
It was beautiful, but now it's sour


         Dm       Bbmaj7                   Dm
Yes it's all gone sour Ah --- ah ah ah --- ah</div>
