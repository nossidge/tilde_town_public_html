She's Always a Woman
Billy Joel


Eb   Ebsus4   Eb   Bb


        Bb          Eb             Bb             Eb
She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
        Eb        Ab             Eb          Ab
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
        Bb      Eb            Bb           G
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
    Cm           Cm/Bb           Ab       Bb       Eb  Ab  Eb
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me


She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me


Cm  F                 Bb Dm/A Gm                   Ab Ab/G
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
Fm                 Bb
She's ahead of her time
Ebm Ab                  C#                      Bbm
Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in
                     F
She just changes her mind


And she'll promise you more than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me


Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind


She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me</div>
