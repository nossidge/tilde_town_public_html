Redemption Song
Bob Marley & the Wailers
(pasty white boy version)


[Verse 1]
    G                  Em
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
C                      D
Sold I to the merchant ships
G                  Em
Minutes after they took I
C                   D
From the bottomless pit
       G        Em
But my hand was made strong
C                  D
By the hand of the Almighty
   G               Em
We forward in this generation
C      D
Triumphantly

[Chorus]
                  G
Won't you help to sing
C     D        G
These songs of freedom?
C     D          Em
Cause all I ever have
C  D       G
Redemption songs
C  D       G
Redemption songs

[Verse 2]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfil the book

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 Reprieve]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
