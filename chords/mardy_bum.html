Arctic Monkeys


D      F#      G      F#m      Em      A


D                   F#
Well now then Mardy Bum
           G
I see your frown and it's like
F#m             Em           (A)
looking down the barrel of a gun
            D
And it goes off
                       F#
And out come all these words
             G             F#m
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
  Em                    A
A side I much prefer, it's one that


G                 A
Laughs and jokes around
         D              A
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
   Bm                            (A)
To get things off the ground and it was
G          A
Up up and away
             D             A
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
     Bm
On a day like today, when you're all
G             A
Argumentative and you've got the face on


D      F#      G      F#m      Em      A


D                   F#
Well now then Mardy Bum
          G       F#m
Oh I'm in trouble again
Em        A            D
Aren't I? I thought as much.
                       F#
Coz you've turned over there
             G          F#m
Pulling that silent disappointment face
Em                   A
The one that I can't bear. Can't we...


G               A
Laugh and joke around
         D              A
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
   Bm                            (A)
To get things off the ground and it was
G          A
Up up and away
             D             A
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
     Bm
On a day like today, when you're all
G             A
Argumentative and you've got the face on


F#5                  G5
Yeah I'm sorry I was late
F#5                                      G5
I missed the train and the traffic was a state
F#5                                  G5
I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
F#5                                           G5
Oh when you say I don't care, but of course I do
                A5
Yeah I clearly do.


D      F#      G      F#m      Em      A


   G               A
So laugh and joke around
         D              A
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
   Bm                            (A)
To get things off the ground and it was
G          A
Up up and away
             D             A
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
     Bm
On a day like today when you're all
G             A                       D
Argumentative and you've got the face on
