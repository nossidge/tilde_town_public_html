Heartbeats
José González version


[Verse 1]
Eb   
One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
Cm   
We had a promise made
Ab   
Four hands and then away
Eb   
Both under influence
We had divine scent
Cm   
To know what to say
Ab   
Mind is a razor blade

[Chorus]
Eb   
To call for hands of above
To lean on
Cm   
Wouldn't be good enough
Ab   
For me, no

[Verse 2]
One night of magic rush
The start of simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bb                                Ab
And you, you knew the hand of the devil
Bb                          Ab
And you, kept us awake with wolves teeth
                                    Cm
Sharing different heartbeats in one night

[Chorus]</div>
