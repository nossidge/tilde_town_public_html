A Whiter Shade of Pale
Procol Harum


C  C/B                Am      Am/G
We skipped the light fandango
F      F/E                   Dm    Dm/C
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
G     G/F           Em      Em/D
I was feeling kinda seasick
C       C/B                  Am   Am/G
But the crowd called out for more
F            F/E     Dm     Dm/C
The room was humming harder
G      G/F           Em  Em/D
As the ceiling flew away
C       C/B            Am      Am/G
When we called out for another drink
F          F/E       Dm
The waiter brought a tray

G7        C  C/B      Am   Am/G
And so it was___ that later____
F      F/E             Dm   Dm/C
As the miller told his tale
G        G/F                 Em      Em/D
That her face, at first just ghostly
         C     F         C    G
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale</div>
