After Hours
The Velvet Underground

        Bb         G7
 If you close the door
     Cm                  F
 The night could last forever
           Bb        G7
 Leave the sunshine out
     Cm             F
 And say hello to never
 

         Bb                              Bb7
 All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
   Eb                         Ebm
 I wish this could happen to me
            Bb         G7
 But if you close the door
      Cm            F            Bb
 I'll never have to see the day again

            Bb         G7
 But if you close the door
     Cm                  F
 The night could last forever
           Bb          G7
 Leave the wine glass out
     Cm               F
 And drink a toast to never
 
 Bb                           Bb7
 Someday I know someone will look into my eyes
            Eb
 And say hello
                        Ebm
 You're my very special one
            Bb         G7
 But if you close the door
      Cm            F           Bb
 I'll never have to see the day again
 
  
[Bridge]
 
 Gm         D7          Gm       D7
 Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
     Gm        D7          Gm        Gm F# F       
 And people on subways and trains
         Cm          G7           Cm         G7
 Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
       Eb                       F
 Oh but people look well in the dark
 

 [Chorus]
 
        Bb         G7
 If you close the door
     Cm                  F
 The night could last forever
           Bb        G7  
 Leave the sunshine out
     Cm           F
 And say hello to never


         Bb                              Bb7
 All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
   Eb                         Ebm
 I wish this could happen to me
            Bb         G7
 Cause if you close the door
      Cm            F            Bb
 I'll never have to see the day again



     Cm            F           Bb       G7
 I'll never have to see the day again (once more)
      Cm            F           Bb
 I'll never have to see the day again</div>
