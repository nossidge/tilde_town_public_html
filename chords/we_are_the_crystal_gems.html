We Are The Crystal Gems
Rebecca Sugar


G                         B
If you're evil and you're on the rise
C                    Cm
You can count on the four of us taking you down
G                         B
Cause we're good and evil never beats us
      C                         Cm
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas


G                  B
We are the Crystal Gems
                      C
We'll always save the day
                    Cm
And if you think we can't
                    G
We'll always find a way

That's why the people
B               C
Of this world believe in
           Cm
Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl
    G
