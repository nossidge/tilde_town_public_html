Say You'll Be There
The Spice Girls


Bbm   Eb   F#m   C#

Bbm            Eb                   F#m                   C#
I'm giving you everything, all that joy can bring, this I swear

Bbm       Eb                            F#m                    C#
Last time that we had this conversation I decided we should be friends
Bbm           Eb                              F#m                     C#
but now we're going round in circles, tell me will this deja vu never end?

Bbm                         Eb                     F#m                           C#
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love, well I never ever thought that would be
Bbm           Eb                           F#m                      C#
This time you gotta take it easy, throwing far too much emotions at me

        B                    F#               C#m           Ab7
But any fool can see they're falling, I gotta make you understand


Bbm            Eb                  F#m                  C#
I'm giving you everything all that joy can bring this I swear
Bbm            Eb                 F#m                 C#
And all that I want from you is a promise you will be there
