'39
Queen


[Verse 1]
       Eb                    Fm
In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
       C#        Ab         Eb
In the days when lands were few
         Fm                       C#
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Ebsus4   Eb         Ab
Sweetest sight ever seen
        Eb                         Edim
And the night followed day and the storytellers say
         Fm                  Bbm
That the score brave souls inside
    Ab                        Eb
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
             C#          Eb            Ab
Never looked back, never feared, never cried


[Chorus]
          Ab                         C#
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
          Ab              Eb
Don't you hear me calling you
           Ab      C7     Fm
Write your letters in the sand
Ab      C#    Ab        Bbm
For the day I take your hand
       Ab            Eb            Ab
In the land that our grandchildren knew


[Verse 2]
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
Oh so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me


[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew


[Outro]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead
Pity me</div>
