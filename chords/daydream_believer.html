Daydream Believer
The Monkees


            G               Am
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
       Bm              C
Of the bluebird as she sings
    G            Em               A7     D7
The six-o-clock alarm would never ring
       G            Am
But it rings and I rise
         Bm              C
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
   G       Em      C    D7     G
My shaving razor's cold and it stings


C        D      Bm
Cheer up sleepy Jean
C       D      Em   C
Oh what can it mean to a
G          C
Daydream believer and a
G   Em     A7      D7
homecoming queen


    G               Am
You once thought of me
     Bm                  C
As a white knight on his steed
G                Em          A7   D7
Now you know how happy I can be
        G                    Am
And our good times start and end
        Bm            C
Without dollar one to spend
    G        Em   C     D7     G
But how much baby do we really need</div>
