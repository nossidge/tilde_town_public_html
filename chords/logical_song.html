The Logical Song
Supertramp


[Verse 1]
Cm                               Abmaj7      Gm7
When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
  Bb                  Fm7/Ab     F7/A
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
            Cm                                  Abmaj7     Gm7
And all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily
Bb        Fm7/Ab    Am7-5
Joyfully, playfully watching me
              Cm                       Abmaj7    Gm7
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Bb       Fm7/Ab       F7/A
Logical, responsible, practical
         Cm                              Abmaj7  Gm7
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Bb             Fm7/Ab   Am7-5
Clinical, intellectual, cynical


[Chorus]
          Eb                          Am7-5/Eb
There are times when all the world's asleep
                      Abmaj7
The questions run too deep
                  Db  Dbmaj7/C  Bbm7  Bbm7/Ab
For such a simple man
          Eb                                Am7-5/Eb
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
                   Abmaj7
I know it sounds absurd
                          Db  Dbmaj7/C  Bbm7  Bbm7/Ab
But please, tell me who I am


[Verse 2]
            Cm                               Abmaj7        Gm7
I said, now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
  Bb       Fm7/Ab     F7/A
A liberal, fanatical, criminal
          Cm                              Abmaj7      Gm7
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
  Bb            Fm7/Ab      F7/A
Respectable, presentable, a vegetable

Oh, take, take, take it, yeah!
