All The Way Down
Glen Hansard


Bm       Bm/A       Bm/G
You have broken me, all the way down
Bm   Bm/A    Bm/G
Down upon my knees
Bm       Bm/A       Bm/G
You have broken me, all the way now
Bm            Bm/A         Bm/G
You'll be the last, you'll see


F#m            G
Some fight you gave
A      F#m        G
When I pushed you away
A    D
From me
           A
And in the morning
Bm       G
When you turn in
D       A      Bm
I'll be far to sea


Bm             Bm/A       Bm/G
(and) You have broken me, all the way down
Bm            Bm/A         Bm/G
You'll be the last, you'll see


Bm    Bm/A   Bm/G
Bm    Bm/A   Bm/G
Da di da, da di da


F#m                 G
What chance have we got
A        F#m          G
When you missed every shot
A    D
From me
           A 
And in the morning
Bm       G
When you turn in
D       A      Bm
I'll be out of reach
D          A
And in the darkness
Bm        G
When you find this
D       A      Bm
I'll be far to sea


Bm             Bm/A       Bm/G
(and) You have broken me, all the way down
Bm            Bm/A         Bm/G
You'll be the last, you'll see

You'll be the last, you'll see</div>
