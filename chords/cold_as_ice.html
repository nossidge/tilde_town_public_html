Cold as Ice
Foreigner


[Verse 1]
Ebm                  B                                Ebm   B
You're as cold as ice you're willing to sacrifice our love
Ebm                   B
You never take advice. Some day you'll pay the price, I know

[Chorus]
     F#                         C#
I've seen it before, it happens all the time
       Ebm                             B
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
       F#                       C#
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away
  Ebm                      C#
A fortune in feelings, but some day you'll pay

[Verse 2]
Ebm                  B                                Ebm   B
You're as cold as ice you're willing to sacrifice our love
Ebm              B
You want paradise but some day you'll pay the price, I know

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ebm  C# B
Cold as ice - you know that you are
Ebm  C# B
Cold as ice - as cold as ice to me
Ebm  C# B
Cold as ice

[Outro]
Ebm   B   (repeat to fade)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice</div>
