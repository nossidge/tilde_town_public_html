Hallelujah
Leonard Cohen


     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                   F           G
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
    Am             F
The minor fall the major lift
    G               E           Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     F           C   G   C   G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah


Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah</div>
