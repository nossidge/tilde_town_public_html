Hallelujah
Leonard Cohen


  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                   F           G
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
    Am             F
The minor fall the major lift
    G               E           Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C   G   C   G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah [x4]


Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah [x4]


There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah [x4]


Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
