The Rock Show
Blink-182


[Verse 1]
A   
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
D                      E
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
A   
I couldn't wait for the summer at the Warped Tour
D                    E
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

[Verse 2]
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

[Chorus]
          A                     F#m         D
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
A                      F#m             D
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
A                    F#m                  D
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
E                        D
Everything's better when she's around
  E                              D
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
  E                     D           E          A
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

[Verse 3]
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
17 without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
F#m                            D
Black and white picture of her on my wall
         A                        E
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
F#m                D
And if I ever got another chance,
              A                         E       D
I'd still ask her to dance, because she kept me waiting

[Chorus]
