Nights in White Satin
The Moody Blues


Em              D      Em                 D
Nights in white satin, never reaching the end,
C            G        F                Em
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Em          D              Em                D
Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before
C             G         F              Em
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

       A               C
'Cos I love you, yes I love you
         Em       D   Em   D
Oh how I love you

Em        D       Em           D
Gazing at people, some hand in hand
C             G             F               Em
Just what I'm going through they can't understand
Em          D        Em                   D
Some try to tell me, thoughts they cannot defend
C             G           F                  Em
Just what you want to be, you will be in the end

      A               C
And I love you, yes I love you
         Em        D        Em       D
Oh how I love you, oh how I love you</div>
