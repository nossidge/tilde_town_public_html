Overkill
Man at Work


D              A
I can't get to sleep
C                 G
I think about the implications
D                A
Of diving in too deep
C                G
And possibly the complications
D             A
Especially at night
C            G
I worry over situations
D                A
I know will be alright
C                 G
Perhaps it's just imagination


Bm                   Asus4  A
Day after day it reappears
Bm                             Asus4     A
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
F#sus4   F#            G
Ghosts appear and fade away
Asus4     A


D                 A
Alone between the sheets
C            G
Only brings exasperation
D                     A
It's time to walk the streets
C         G
Smell the desperation
D                       A
At least there's pretty lights
C                         G
And though there's little variation
D                A
It nullifies the night
C        G
From overkill


Bm                   Asus4  A
Day after day it reappears
Bm                             Asus4     A
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
F#sus4   F#            G
Ghosts appear and fade away
Asus4     A
Come back another day


D              A
I can't get to sleep
C                 G
I think about the implications
D                A
