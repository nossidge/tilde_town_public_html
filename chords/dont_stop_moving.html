Don't Stop Movin'
S Club 7


[Funky riff]
Gm   
Don't stop moving to the funky, funky beat
Don't stop moving to the funky, funky beat
Cm   
Don't stop moving to the funky, funky beat
Gm   
Don't stop moving to the S Club beat


Gm   
DJ got the party started, there's no end in sight
Everybody's moving to the rhythm that's inside
       Cm                                       Gm
It's a crazy world, but tonight's the right situation
Don't get left behind

Gm   
I can feel the music moving through me everywhere
Ain't no destination, baby we don't even care
          Cm                                   Gm
There's a place to be if you need the right education
Let it take you there

         Eb          D
And just go with the magic baby
Gm7                        C
I can see it there in your eyes
Eb            D
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go


[Chorus]
Gm                 Bb
Don't stop moving, can you feel the music?
Cm                 D
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Gm                 Bb
Don't stop moving, find your own way to it
Cm   
Listen to the music
D   
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now


[Funky riff]


Gm   
You can touch the moment, almost feel it in the air
Don't know where we're going baby, we don't even care
         Cm                          Gm
Ain't no mystery, just use your imagination
Let it take you there

         Eb          D
And just go with the magic baby
Gm7                        C
I can see it there in your eyes
Eb            D
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go


[Chorus]


Eb                D
Forget about your fears tonight
Gm                               Bb
Listen to your heart, let's just touch the sky
Eb         D
No need to reason why
Just listen to the sound, let it make you come alive


[Chorus]
