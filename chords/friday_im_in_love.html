Friday, I'm in Love
The Cure


[Verse 1]
Eb              Ab
I don't care if Monday's blue
Eb                 Bb
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Cm               Ab
Thursday I don't care about you
     Eb             Bb
It's Friday, I'm in love
Eb             Ab
Monday you can fall apart
Eb                  Bb
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Cm               Ab
Thursday doesn't even start
     Eb             Bb
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Ab        Bb
Saturday, wait
Cm            Ab
Sunday always comes too late
Eb                Bb
But Friday, never hesitate

[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Verse 3]
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Cm                Ab
Dressed up to the eyes
                    Eb
It's a wonderful surprise
            Bb                     Cm
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
                  Ab
Throwing out your frown
                       Eb
And just smiling at the sound
                  Bb                        Cm
And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
                  Ab
Always take a big bite
                     Eb
It's such a gorgeous sight
           Bb                       Cm
To see you eat in the middle of the night
                   Ab
You can never get enough
               Eb
Enough of this stuff
            Bb
It's Friday I'm in Love

[Verse 4]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love</div>
