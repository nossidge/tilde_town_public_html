One Tin Soldier
The Original Caste

[Verse 1]
F               C
Listen children to a story
Dm               Am
That was written long ago
Bb                   F
'Bout a kingdom on a mountain
Bb             C
And the valley folk below
F               C
On the mountain was a treasure
Dm            Am
Buried deep beneath a stone
Bb             F
And the valley people swore
       Bb                C    F
They'd have it for their very own

[Chorus]
F                      C
Go ahead and hate your neighbour
Bb                   F
Go ahead and cheat a friend
F                    C
Do it in the name of heaven
Bb                F
Justify it in the end
      F                     C
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Bb                 F
Come the judgement day
       F              C
On the bloody morning after
                       F
One tin soldier rides away

[Verse 2]
So the people of the valley
Sent a message up the hill
Asking for the buried treasure
Tons of gold for which they'd kill
Came an answer from the kingdom
"With our brothers we will share
All the secrets of our mountain
All the riches buried there"

[Verse 3 (key up one tone)]
G              D
Now the valley cried with anger
Em                  Bm
"Mount your horses, draw your sword"
C                   G
And they killed the mountain people
C                 D
So they won their just reward
G                D
Now they stood beside the treasure
Em              Bm
On the mountain darkened red
C                    G
Turned the stone and looked beneath it
C                           G
"Peace on earth" was all it said

[Chorus (key up one tone)]</div>
